## My process

1. I started with the markup on index.html, complying with HTML5 semantic tags and standards as much as possible.
2. The styling provided by the project briefing was implemented first, followed by the classes I came up with on the markup.
3. I used Figma to acquire all the right dimensions involved in the layout and implemented them in the appropriate CSS classes.
4. The [CSS Cube](https://cube.fyi/) methodology was used when coding the stylesheet and some of the conventions from BEM were used when naming classes.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Cube CSS methodology

### What I learned
- How to implement a color transparency along with an overlayed image on a hover effect.
- I had to use a few CSS variables in order to guarantee the adequate positioning of the "view icon" over the NFT preview image on different viewport dimensions.
